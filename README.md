# My Personal Site

This is my personal site. I like it a lot.
It's for fun more than looking professional. Hence, it is named after the second-largest phylum of invertebrate animals.

## Stack

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- atrament.js painting pad library

## Notes

A few links are broken and hardcoded. GitHub pages is powered by Jekyll. Jekyll's `_config.yml` file
should be used to make links more consistent and editable. [Potentially useful link](

## Functionalities

- Pictures from trip to Taiwan have lazy loading set. As soon as image element is an active view, it loads.
Otherwise, a default picture of clouds and rain is being used.
- You.html: Vanilla JS functions take data hardcoded into arrays and render them into color palettes, display a random
previously made artwork, allow for painting download, allow for paintbrush color to switch when clicking a color in the box range,
and for painting to work on an embedded paint paed.
- About Me: There is a noscript tag for visitors without JS enabled. The focal point is a set of quote
and image pairs that are displayed in a randomized fashion.
- Elements are draggable as a hidden surprise throughout, thanks to one of the jQuery draggable libraries.
