    <p style="line-height: 2;">My mother is the sea.<br />
      Her fingers are chartreuse bulbous nubs of kelp.<br />
      Her teeth, brine encrusted shattered sea urchin bones.<br />
      <br />
      When I was little she would massage warm coconut oil through my hair,<br/>
      and the bouncy, tangled curls would sink down until the oil started dripping silently to the floor.<br />
      <br />
      Now, she gently strokes my ears with her fingers and tells me<br />
      <br />
      Never<br />
      Turn Your Back To the Ocean<br />
      But if you do,<br />
      float<br />
      like an upended buoy with its back submerged in the world's leftover filth<br />
      follow<br />
      like the last piece of driftwood riding the currents above a bustling coral reef<br />
      survive<br />
      survive<br />
      survive<br />

		<h3>Context</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 2;">
      Yesterday my mom casually, almost gleefully told me a story of a car full of Japanese people
      trapped by tsunami waters. Rather than panicking and screaming, they quietly awaited death
      and drowned. It was her example of how repressed Japanese people can be. I imagined six of them,
      some hands clenched and some hands floating, waiting. I swore repeatedly and told her not to invoke
      tragedies like that in casual conversation.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2;">
      Today I needed a full bladder for an ultrasound, so I drank water until I puked. I penned this
      poem in the waiting room to feel better.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2;">
      The rest you should infer.
