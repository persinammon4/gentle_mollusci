		<h4> Absinthe licorice </h4>

<h1 id="a-product-review">A Product Review</h1>

<p>Vincent Van Gogh was binge drinking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe">absinthe</a> the day he cut off his right ear. Singapore banned absinthe until November 2009, when it was allowed in due to popular niche demand. My first time trying absinthe was on the seventh floor of a dorm facing the Bay Area at twilight. My perpetually salty blockchain friend handed me a flask from the breast pocket of his tan trench coat (he was barely 21). I felt it burn all the way down, a skin stripping sensation only saved by a tingle of fennel at the end. If ambrosia is the nectar of the gods, absinthe is the devil’s juice.</p>

<p>I am assuming the audience knows what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquorice_(confectionery)">licorice</a> is (another fennel and anise based concoction which people either love or hate). I love it.</p>

<p>Now there are certain things in this world that just go together. One of them is vodka and gummy bears. Gummy bears swollen to a preponderously boozy goodness…………maybe…..perhaps?…..the licoricey minty fenneliness will mingle into a previously undiscovered sweet and deadly candy? I had to try it.</p>

<h2 id="absinthe-licorice-recipe">Absinthe Licorice Recipe</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the ingredients were low quality, but here they are:</p>

<ol>
	<ul>Hapsburg Vanilla Liquor Flavored Absinthe (disturbingly yet awesomely same day delivery in a nation with disturbingly and not awesomely flaky post)</ul>
  		<ol>
				<ul>Quantity: 0.7 L</ul>
			</ol>
	<ul>YumEarth Organic Licorice, Black</ul>
			<ol>
				<ul>Quantity: 20 ounces</ul>
			</ol>
</ol>

<p>Recipe:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Daiso version of tupperware.</li>
  <li>Fill with licorice.</li>
  <li>Drown with absinthe.</li>
  <li>Close Daiso version of tupperware.</li>
  <li>Let sit in fridge for 24 hours.</li>
</ol>

<p>After opening and sampling one to seven pieces, I realized that the licorice was too hard. Unlike gummy bear, which soaks and sweats vodka evenly, this licorice gets very hard on the inside with a disgustingly soft and flaky layer on the outside.</p>

<p>More importantly, it won’t even get you drunk.</p>

<p>I did save this potent leftover licorice absinthe juice that looks like it’s gonna kill someone.</p>

<p>Perhaps a softer Trader Joe’s licorice and a harder alcohol….</p>

<p>Verdict: Try again with better ingredients. 0.5/5</p>
