<p>Today I luncheoned with an anthropologist couple above 50 years old. After the meeting I thought to myself - wow, they’re the first normal professor couple I’ve met in my life. But no, now that I think on it, they are quite abnormal too. The only difference is that they have both high IQ and EQ. While we talked I was impressed and comforted by their keen observation skills. And how sweet they were to each other. Like this is how people can be and there are people who like people like I do, too.</p>

<p>One told me of how Singapore casually threw 7 million into subsidized scooters for GrabFood deliverers, which is quite innovative. The other corrected me on my simplistic skepticism and told me of anthropologic methodology.</p>

<p>I expected to pump them for information; instead they pumped me for information with kind precision.</p>

<p>As I left for office, I had thoughts like this:</p>

<p>I want to grow older and improve.</p>

<p>I want a tender, fun relationship like theirs.</p>

<p>And do you believe in control over your life?</p>

<p>Do you? I do. I wish my friends would grow up and think so too. I wish they would have more confidence in themselves, but I think it’s gonna take them a couple years to calm down and truly realize everything and everyone is imperfect (Everyone is imperfect is so much better of a sentence than no one is perfect).</p>

<p>I told my friends I fully intend on outliving the planet and that 25 is less than a quarter of my lifespan and I semi-meant it.</p>

<p>If health wasn’t a problem, would everyone want to live forever? I don’t think it’s possible to get bored in this world. Explore other worlds? I’m not sure why anyone would want to leave Earth. Astronauts (and physics majors) are either genius who know something I don’t or the stupidest smart people I can think of. Okay, I really think the latter.</p>

<p>I want to continue to mature and discover the emotional and aesthetic truths of this world.</p>
